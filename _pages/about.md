I am a cofounder and CTO at [Cobot](https://www.cobot.me) since 2010. I manage a team of two backend and one frontend developers. I write code mostly in Ruby ([Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)) and TypeScript ([Ember JS](https://emberjs.com/)). I am a big advocate of testing and agile developent. On that journey we are currently at [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

I once wrote a persistence libray for [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) called [Couch Potato](https://github.com/langalex/couch_potato), which we still use.

Outside of software development, I am and have been [building a smallish (6.50m) sailing yacht](/making-boats) out of epoxy and plywood since 2016. I also make things on 3d printers and occasionally videos.
